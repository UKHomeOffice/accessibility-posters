  <main>

    Do write in plain English
    <img src="images/deafHardOfHearing/doThis.svg" alt="An example of a clear instruction: Do this.">

    Don't use complicated words or figures of speech
    <img class="tip flexChild" src="images/deafHardOfHearing/rainingCatsAndDogs.svg" alt="Dogs above an umbrella, to represent the idiom 'raining cats and dogs'">

    <p>People who use British Sign Language may consider this to be their first language. They may consider English to be their second language. Sentence structure differs between these two languages and therefore content should be kept simple to make it easier for BSL users to read.</p>


    Do use subtitles or provide transcripts for videos
    <img src="images/deafHardOfHearing/ccSpeechBubble.svg" alt="An icon representing captions: a speech bubble containing the acronym CC">

    Don't put content in audio or video only
    <img class="tip flexChild" src="images/deafHardOfHearing/loudspeaker.svg" alt="A loudspeaker with soundwaves coming out of it">

    <p>Users who are Deaf, deaf or hard of hearing will need to access your videos in a visual way. Do not rely on the userâ€™s ability to lipread to understand what is being said. Videos should include subtitles, a transcript, or a British Sign Language interpreter - the more of these you can include the more user needs you will meet. </p>


    Do use a linear, logical layout
    <img src="images/deafHardOfHearing/neatTablet.svg" alt="A tablet screen layout, with one column, that follows a logical, linear order.">

    Don't make complex layouts and menus
    <img class="tip flexChild" src="images/deafHardOfHearing/complexTabletLayout.svg" alt="A tablet screen layout with no clear, logical order. It has multiple columns of different widths.">

    <p>Users who have English as their second language may find it tiring or difficult to read lots of text. A logical layout can help users judge what content they need to read in order to complete their task. </p>


    Do break up content with sub-headings, images and videos
    <img src="images/deafHardOfHearing/structuredContent.svg" alt="A webpage layout using semantic html elements: a header, a paragraph, an image and a bulleted list.">

    Don't make users read long blocks of content
    <img class="tip flexChild" src="images/deafHardOfHearing/justifiedContent.svg" alt="Two large blocks of justified content.">

    <p>British Sign Language is a very visual language - using visuals instead of text may be of benefit to these users, given the right context. Long blocks of text are difficult to read for those whose first language is not English. Headers help to explain the purpose of the copy that follows.</p>


    Do let users ask for their preferred communication support when booking appointments
    <img src="images/deafHardOfHearing/hands.svg" alt="An image of hands, representing sign language.">

    Don't make telephone the only means of contact for users
    <img class="tip flexChild" src="images/deafHardOfHearing/speechBubbles.svg" alt="Two empty speech bubbles, representing a conversation">

    <p>A d/Deaf or hard of hearing user may not be able to answer a phone call. Allow for people to specify how they want to be contacted. If you service requires a face to face interaction, design the interface to allow for the user to request communication support (and what kind of support that needs to be).</p>
