    Do use images and diagrams to support text
    <img src="images/dyslexia/pieChart.svg" alt="Example of a pie chart or diagram that might enhance your text">

    Don't use large blocks of heavy text
    <img class="tip flexChild" src="images/dyslexia/justifiedText.svg" alt="a paragraph of centrally justified text">

    <p>Some people with dyslexia have trouble focusing when reading on a screen. They can experience visual distortion where letters and words get jumbled.  Large blocks of content can be intimidating, use images to help illustrate the point and break up copy.</p>


    Do align text to the left and keep a consistent layout
    <img src="images/dyslexia/leftAlignedText.svg" alt="An example of a paragraph of text aligned to the left.">

    Don't underline words, use italics or write in capitals
    <img class="tip flexChild" src="images/dyslexia/dontDoThisText.svg" alt="an italicised, underlined, sentence written in capitals 'don't do this'">

    <p>A consistent layout will help someone with dyslexia navigate a screen. It will help draw their eyes to relevant content and build familiarity and confidence as they go. Serif fonts have hooks at the end of letter strokes that can cause letters to run together - the same is true for italics.</p>


    Do consider producing materials in other formats (for example, audio or video)
    <img src="images/dyslexia/loudspeaker.svg" alt="a symbol of a speaker emitting sound">

    Don't force users to remember things from previous pages - give reminders and prompts
    <img class="tip flexChild" src="images/dyslexia/cogsInHead.svg" alt="an image of a head with cognitive cogs in it">

    <p>Many people with dyslexia experience anxiety about being able to read and retain the information given to them. They may feel pressure if they are presented with lots of information on separate screens. Some people are able to remember information better if have listened to it or watched on a video. Video, graphics and photos help to create a visual memory.</p>


    Do keep content short and simple, make clear prompts
    <img src="images/dyslexia/structuredContent.svg" alt="a paragraph of text broken up into clear short points.">

    Don't rely on accurate spelling. Use autocorrect or provide suggestions
    <img class="tip flexChild" src="images/dyslexia/dyslexiaAutocorrect.svg" alt="Image an autocorrect preempting the word that they are writing">

    <p>Fewer  words are better for someone who has trouble reading. Use bullet points to help guide a dyslexic user through your content.</p>
    <p>People with dyslexia may find spelling and words order challenging. Tools like predictive text, autocorrect and speech recognition can help them get things right.</p>


    Do let users change the contrast between the background and text
    <img src="images/dyslexia/screenContrast.svg" alt="a symbol of a screen with the contrast control emphasised">

    Don't put too much information in one place
    <img class="tip flexChild" src="images/dyslexia/crowdedScreen.svg" alt="A computer showing a screen with a cluttered layout">

    <p>Many dyslexic users are sensitive to the bright, high contrast colours. They can make words swirl and blur together. Many users adjust their screen contrast or use coloured filters on their screen to help ease this symptom.</p>
